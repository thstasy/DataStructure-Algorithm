##Task 5

Problem Statement:
We have a sorted array that has been rotated circularly. Our task is to find the index of the largest value in this rotated array.

Example:

Let's take an array [4, 5, 1, 2, 3]. This array is sorted in ascending order, but it has been rotated to the right by 2 positions. The largest value in this array is 5, and its index is 1.

Solution Approach:
The provided solution uses a strategy called binary search to efficiently find the index of the largest value.

Here's how it works:

Initialization:

We start with two pointers, left and right, which initially point to the start and end of the array, respectively.
Binary Search:

We repeatedly divide the array into halves and examine the middle element (mid).
If rotatedArray[mid] is greater than rotatedArray[mid + 1], it means rotatedArray[mid] is the largest value, and its index is mid + 1. This is because the array is sorted, and the next element after rotatedArray[mid] would be smaller if it weren't the largest.
If rotatedArray[mid] is greater than or equal to rotatedArray[left], the rotation point is on the right side of mid, so we update left to mid + 1.
Otherwise, the rotation point is on the left side of mid, so we update right to mid.
Termination:

We continue this process until left and right pointers converge, indicating that we have found the largest value.
Return:

Once the pointers converge, left will represent the index of the largest value.
Why This Solution Works:

The binary search approach allows us to efficiently narrow down the search space.
By comparing elements at different positions, we can determine whether the rotation point lies to the left or right of the midpoint, enabling us to adjust our search accordingly.
Key Points to Remember:

Binary search is a technique used to efficiently search a sorted array by repeatedly dividing the search interval in half.
The algorithm provided effectively adapts binary search to handle rotated arrays, enabling us to find the index of the largest value efficiently.
